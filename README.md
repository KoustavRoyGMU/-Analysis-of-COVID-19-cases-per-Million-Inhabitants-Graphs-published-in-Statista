# Problem Statement:
![image](https://github.com/KoustavRoyGMU/-Analysis-of-COVID-19-cases-per-Million-Inhabitants-Graphs-published-in-Statista/assets/113814191/bd4248ba-3640-4ff8-a55e-536fb79d53f6)
We found this graph not to be the best way to represent the information. This does not depict the actual picture of COVID-19 epidemic spread.

# Solution:
We collecetd the worldwide data of COVID-19 spread from CMS website and tried to represent the data in a more effective way.

# Collaborators:
